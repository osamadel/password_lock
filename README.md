# Password Locking System

This password-enabled locking system unlocks if a correct password is entered using the keypad. If an incorrect password is entered, the system shows the remaining number of allowed attempts and ask you for the password again. If 4 incorrect passwords are entered, the systems locks and cannot be unlocked unless the system is connected to the admin PC to reset the password.
